## HISTORY

- Was born in May 30th 1996
- Was born in Tehran, Iran
- Grown up in Tehran and Bandar Abbas
- Moved to Karaj since the age 21
- Studied *computer hardware engineering*
- Started multiple startups in different fields (mostly Free Software and AI)

## PROBLEMS

- P1: Can't come up with new ideas. 
- P2: Everything I think of, a big corporate (such as OpenAI) can and will do better. 
- P3: I can't think of any new ideas which make a BOOM in the industry, at least in the local scene.
- P4: Infrastructure is really expensive and I need better alternatives (such as smaller models or even reliable API's for good models)

## MISSION

- M1: Create a great AI startup which can help humanity grow. 
- M2: Create a good bunch of open-source AI related tools in order to keep the system going even without my supervision. 
- M3: Create enough wealth to support my family and myself. 
- M4: Create charity/philantropistic organizations to help people in the world in many ways possible.

## NARRATIVES

- N1: AI is now the hype and it can help developers or engineers like me find their right place in the industry. This is what motivates me a lot in the field. 
- N2: Open Source means many different things. The best one is having millions of developers want to help your project(s) willingly and this is why I personally am looking for making my projects open source or at least have open source versions of them as well.
- N3: The wealth I may generate with the company I start, may be a support for other projects and also can help me fund/acquire good projects in the space. 

## GOALS

- G1: being featured in international news outlets by February 2026. 
- G2: getting international investors for my new company by March 2026
- G3: Having $1 million (USD) in form of cash in my wallet (crypto or otherwise)
- G4: Getting married before age 32. 
- G5: First kid by 35

## CHALLENGES

- C1: I have anxiety and it causes a lot of disruptions for me. 
- C2: I have ADHD and I can be distracted easily. 
- C3: I live in a super noisy environment. My family have strict rules for lunch/dinner time which is not matching with my waking up/sleeping schedules and it makes me stay up really late. 
- C4: The noise from the environment sometimes goes too high which can't even be avoided by noise-cancelling headphones. 

## IDEAS

- I1: An AI Platform which solves new problems or solves the old problems in a new way. 
- I2: Developing one big (at least 100 billion parameters) language model. 
- I3: Developing one small (3 or 4 billion parameters) language model. 
- I4: Developing a semantic image model (generate and alter images)
- I5: Using AI in order to help other businesses based on their data. 
- I6: Making an AI crypto currency (AI coin)
- I7: Mixing AI and Blockchain
