## HISTORY

- I grew up in the Austin, TX area
- I went to Mission High School, where I was bullied a decent amount
- High school is where I met my 2 life-long friends, Doug and Mitchell who are still my friends today

## PROBLEMS

- P1: Not enough people understand how to build secure open-source software

## MISSION

- M1: Create and promote a standard for building secure open-source software

## NARRATIVES

- N1: I think open-sources software is the future, and it's currently extremely insecure, so I'm building a standard and platform for people to create secure versions of whatever they build
- N2: I am the author of a platform that helps people create secure software.
 
## GOALS

- G1: Go on the Secure Code Warrior podcast by July of 2026
- G2: Get at least 100,000 downloads of SecureOSS by December of 2026
- G3: Wife by 35
- G4: First kid by 36

## CHALLENGES

- C1: I'm super stressed at work and never have time to work on SOSS.
- C2: I'm having trouble building the UI/UX for SOSS
- C3: Someone else has a similar project and it's distracting me and demotivating me
- C4: Hate dating apps

## IDEAS

- I1: Go is the best language because of how universal and fast it is
- I2: All government software should be OSS and run off SOSS
- I3: Adam Smith's invisible hand doesn't apply to FOSS because incentives are misaligned
