## HISTORY

- Was born in May 30th 1996
- Was born in Tehran, Iran
- Grown up in Tehran and Bandar Abbas
- Moved to Karaj since the age 21
- Studied *computer hardware engineering*
- Started multiple startups in different fields (mostly Free Software and AI)

## PROBLEMS

- P1: Can't come up with new ideas. 
- P2: Everything I think of, a big corporate (such as OpenAI) can and will do better. 
- P3: I can't think of any new ideas which make a BOOM in the industry, at least in the local scene.
- P4: Infrastructure is really expensive and I need better alternatives (such as smaller models or even reliable API's for good models)

## MISSION

- M1: Create a great AI startup which can help humanity grow. 
- M2: Create a good bunch of open-source AI related tools in order to keep the system going even without my supervision. 
- M3: Create enough wealth to support my family and myself. 
- M4: Create charity/philantropistic organizations to help people in the world in many ways possible.

## NARRATIVES

- N1: AI is now the hype and it can help developers or engineers like me find their right place in the industry. This is what motivates me a lot in the field. 
- N2: Open Source means many different things. The best one is having millions of developers want to help your project(s) willingly and this is why I personally am looking for making my projects open source or at least have open source versions of them as well.
- N3: The wealth I may generate with the company I start, may be a support for other projects and also can help me fund/acquire good projects in the space. 

## GOALS

- G1: Go on the Secure Code Warrior podcast by July of 2026
- G2: Get at least 100,000 downloads of SecureOSS by December of 2026
- G3: Wife by 35
- G4: First kid by 36

## CHALLENGES

- C1: I'm super stressed at work and never have time to work on SOSS.
- C2: I'm having trouble building the UI/UX for SOSS
- C3: Someone else has a similar project and it's distracting me and demotivating me
- C4: Hate dating apps

## IDEAS

- I1: Go is the best language because of how universal and fast it is
- I2: All government software should be OSS and run off SOSS
- I3: Adam Smith's invisible hand doesn't apply to FOSS because incentives are misaligned
